  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="muted"><strong>Last updated February 27, 2026</strong></p>

  <p>
    This Privacy Policy explains how Huntington Co ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and shares
    information when you use Ducky's Money Bin, a campus event payments and escrow platform.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Scope</h2>
  <p>
    This policy applies to users of the Ducky's Money Bin mobile app, including organization admins,
    organization members, and event participants.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>Depending on how you use the App, we may collect:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Account data such as name, email address, username, and authentication details.</li>
    <li>Organization and event data such as club membership, invites, event signups, and attendance status.</li>
    <li>Payment metadata such as amounts, timestamps, transaction IDs, payout status, and refund status.</li>
    <li>Device and usage data needed for reliability, security, and support.</li>
    <li>Support communications you send to our team.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. How We Use Information</h2>
  <p>We use information to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide account access, org invites, event discovery, and signup workflows.</li>
    <li>Process payments, escrow-like fund holds, refunds, and disbursements.</li>
    <li>Prevent fraud, secure accounts, and investigate abuse or disputes.</li>
    <li>Comply with legal, tax, accounting, and payment-network obligations.</li>
    <li>Operate and improve platform performance and user support.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Payment Processing and Card Data</h2>
  <p>
    Payments are processed by Stripe. Card numbers and sensitive payment credentials are handled by Stripe's
    systems; we do not store full card numbers in our app databases.
  </p>
  <p>
    We receive limited payment-related records needed to operate transactions, support refunds, and satisfy
    compliance obligations.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Escrow-Like Fund Handling</h2>
  <p>
    For paid events, funds may be held until event completion and then disbursed to the organization,
    subject to fraud checks, dispute review, and policy requirements.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Refund Policy Handling</h2>
  <p>
    Refund outcomes are based on each organization's event policy. Full or partial refunds may be available
    depending on cancellation timing and event rules. Transaction and payment processing fees, including
    Stripe-related fees, may be non-refundable unless required by law.
  </p>

  <h2>7. How We Share Information</h2>
  <p>We may share information with:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Payment providers and financial partners that support payment operations.</li>
    <li>Service providers that host infrastructure and support platform delivery.</li>
    <li>Authorities or counterparties when required for legal compliance, fraud prevention, or disputes.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    We do not sell personal information for money.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Data Retention</h2>
  <p>
    We keep data only as long as necessary for service delivery, fraud prevention, legal compliance,
    recordkeeping, and dispute handling.
  </p>

  </p>

  <h2>11. Security</h2>
  <p>
    We use reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect information. No system is guaranteed
    to be perfectly secure.
  </p>

  <h2>12. Changes to This Policy</h2>
