  <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
  <p class="muted"><strong>Last updated February 27, 2026</strong></p>

  <p>
    These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of Ducky's Money Bin (the "App"), a campus event
    payments and escrow platform operated by Huntington Co ("we," "us," or "our"). By creating an
    account or using the App, you agree to these Terms.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Service Overview</h2>
  <p>
    Ducky's Money Bin helps campus clubs and organizations create events, invite members, collect event
    payments, and manage disbursement of collected funds after event completion.
  </p>
  <p>
    Organizations can define event-level attendance and refund policies. Members can view eligible events,
    sign up, cancel according to policy, and receive applicable refunds.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Accounts and Eligibility</h2>
  <p>
    You must provide accurate information and keep your account credentials secure. You are responsible for
    activity that occurs through your account. If you believe your account is compromised, contact
    <a href="mailto:support@pandabyte.dev">support@pandabyte.dev</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Organizations and Member Responsibilities</h2>
  <p>
    Organizations are responsible for event accuracy, attendance policy configuration, refund settings,
    and lawful use of funds. Members are responsible for reviewing event details and applicable policies
    before submitting payment.
  </p>
  <p>
    We do not guarantee event quality, attendance outcomes, or organizer performance.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Payments and Stripe Processing</h2>
  <p>
    Payment processing is provided by Stripe and related financial partners. By paying through the App,
    you also agree to Stripe's applicable terms and privacy practices.
  </p>
  <p>
    We do not store full payment card numbers in our application databases. Card handling is performed by
    Stripe's hosted infrastructure and tokenization flows.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Escrow and Disbursement</h2>
  <p>
    For eligible paid events, funds are held in an escrow-like workflow until the event is marked complete
    under platform rules and organizational requirements. After completion and any required review period,
    funds are disbursed to the designated organization account.
  </p>
  <p>
    We may delay or withhold disbursement where needed for fraud prevention, risk review, dispute
    investigation, legal compliance, or payment-network requirements.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Cancellations and Refunds</h2>
  <p>
    Refund eligibility is determined by each organization's configured policy and any event-specific terms.
    Where a refund is issued, payment processing or transaction fees (including Stripe-related costs) may
    be non-refundable, unless otherwise required by law.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Prohibited Conduct</h2>
  <p>You may not use the App to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Submit false identity, event, or payment information.</li>
    <li>Engage in fraud, money laundering, abuse, or unauthorized charge activity.</li>
    <li>Interfere with platform security, availability, or normal operation.</li>
    <li>Violate campus policies or applicable laws.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>8. Suspension and Termination</h2>
  <p>
    We may suspend or terminate access if we reasonably believe these Terms, law, or platform safety
    requirements are violated.
  </p>

  <h2>9. Disputes and Chargebacks</h2>
  <p>
    Users should first contact the organization and support team for resolution. Chargebacks or payment
    disputes may affect event access and can trigger review of organization disbursements.
  </p>

  <h2>10. Disclaimer and Liability Limits</h2>
  <p>
    The App is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis. To the maximum extent permitted by law,
    we disclaim implied warranties and are not liable for indirect, incidental, consequential, special,
    exemplary, or punitive damages arising from your use of the App.
  </p>

  <h2>11. Changes to These Terms</h2>
  <p>
    We may update these Terms from time to time. Updated Terms will be posted at this page with a revised
    "Last updated" date.
  </p>
